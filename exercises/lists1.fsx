//  Lists are a big part of functional programming langages and F# is no exception. You may be familar with List<T>
//  in C# however F# lists are quite different, essentially being based on good old dependable singly-linked lists (but
//  using tuples) whereas C# lists use arrays.
//
//  A naive implementation of an F# list could look like:
//
//  type List<'T> =
//  | ([]) of List<'T>
//  | (::) of Head: 'T * Tail: List<'T>
//
//  In F# an empty list is represented by [] and constructing by the :: (cons) operator. Head represents the first item
//  in the list and tail all the items apart from the first.
//
//  Let's see some examples for constructing lists - copy the following into the REPL to see the result.

//  You can append to a list using the '@' symbol, however this iterates through the items in the first list before

//  Write a list comprehension that produces the numbers one to ten followed by ten down to one.

// Another way to create lists is through list comprehensions using the for .. in syntax.
