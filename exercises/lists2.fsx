//  A useful feature of lists is the ability to pattern match them. Using the cons and empty list symbols
//  you can match pretty much anywhere in a list.
//
//  The following examples shows some simple matching on a list by splitting between the head, tail and an empty list.
//  Another thing to note is the use of the underscore which is used when you don't care specifically about the value.
//  In match expressions they're often used as the catch all condition.
