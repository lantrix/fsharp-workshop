//  Now that you have good idea of what lists are and how to construct them, let's look at some of the common functions
//  that are used with them.

// List.map lets you apply a function to each item in the list.
// The LINQ equivalent is Select
[ 1 .. 10 ]
|> List.map (fun x -> x * x)

// List.filter lets you filter items in the list that conform to the predicate passed in.
// The LINQ equivalent is Where
[ 1 .. 10 ]
|> List.filter (fun x -> x % 2 = 0)

// List.sum will return the sum of the items in the list.
[ 1 .. 10]
|> List.sum

// List.length will return the number of items in the list.
[ 1 .. 10 ]
|> List.length

// List.rev will reverse the items in the list
[ 1 .. 10 ]
|> List.rev

// List.reduce will successively apply a function to each item in the list, passing in the accumulated value with
// the list item on each iteration result in a value of the same type as the list
[ 1 .. 10 ]
|> List.reduce (fun acc x -> acc + x)

// List.fold, like List.reduce, will apply a function to each item in the list, however it starts off with an initial
// value that is passed in and does not have to be of the same type as the list.
// The LINQ equivalent for this is Aggregate
[ 1 .. 10 ]
|> List.fold (fun state x -> sprintf "%s %d" state x) "Numbers:"

// sum the all the numbers divisible by three and five from 1 to 100

let booya =
    [1 .. 100]
        |> List.filter (fun x -> (x % 3 = 0 && x % 5 = 0))
    |> List.sum

let sum35 () =
    [1 .. 100]
        |> List.filter (fun x -> (x % 3 = 0 && x % 5 = 0))
    |> List.sum

test "Sum the all the numbers divisible by three and five from 1 to 100" (fun () ->
  sum35  () = 315
)

// Write a function that calculates the numbers divisible by three and five from 1 to 100 and outputs as a
// comma separated list.

let booya =
    [1 .. 100]
        |> List.filter (fun x -> (x % 3 = 0 && x % 5 = 0))
        |> List.map string
        |> List.reduce (fun acc x -> acc + ", " + x)

let print35 () =
    [1 .. 100]
        |> List.filter (fun x -> (x % 3 = 0 && x % 5 = 0))

// Now let's see if we can write a function that can take a list of numbers and split them into a tuple of two
// lists of even numbers and odd numbers (this is essentially what List.partition does - but you get to implement it
// this time!)

// Let's try something a little more challenging and see if we can write bubble sort using List.fold and a simple
// match expression. A useful feature of match expressions you may not have come across are 'when guards', which are
// conditions you can attach to the matches:
//      match something with
//      | head :: tail when head > x  -> "head is greater than x"
//      | head :: tail when head < x  -> "head is less than x"

// For the following exercises we're going to use some occupations taken from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
// We'll load this up using a familar .NET library and then convert it to an F# list for our purposes
// Uh oh, we've thrown something else in there too - the lazy computation. This is the same as Lazy<T> you'd find
// in C# and effectively delaying the execution of the code until a later point

let occupations = lazy (System.IO.File.ReadLines(__SOURCE_DIRECTORY__ + "/ANZSCO-occupations.txt") |> Seq.toList)

// (A) -- alternative title
// (N) -- occupation in nec category - not elsewhere classified
// (P) -- principal title
// (S) -- specialisation
//
// Let's create a union type that can handle this:

type AnzscoClassification =
  | Alternative of string
  | NotElsewhereClassified of string
  | Principal of string
  | Specialisation of string

// Now, you'll find the key on the end of each occupation, preceded by a space. See if you can convert the list of
// occupations in a list of AnszcoClassifications. You will need to use a match expression inside conversion function
// and you can use the .EndsWith to help as well.
// eg.
// match occ with
// | s when s.EndsWith(" (A)") -> Alternative s
